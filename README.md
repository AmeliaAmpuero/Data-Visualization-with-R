<h1>Data Visualization with R
<h2>MODULE 1: Introduction to Data Viasualization</h2>
I learned how to effectively communicate data-driven insights through visualization. Instead of just looking at numbers, I explored how to bring data to life using visual storytelling techniques. I worked with the ggplot2 package in R to create various chart types, including bar charts, histograms, and pie charts, using both qualitative and quantitative data. This module gave me a strong foundation in the core principles of data visualization.
  
<h2>MODULE 2: Basic Plots, Maps, and Customization</h2>
I expanded my data visualization skills by creating scatter plots, line plots, and box plots using ggplot2. I also customized these visualizations by adding annotations, modifying axis titles, and adjusting text labels for better readability. Additionally, I learned how to use faceting to visualize different levels of categorical variables and explored various themes to improve the aesthetics of my charts. Another key skill I developed was working with geolocation data to create interactive maps using the Leaflet library.

<h2>MODULE 3: Dashboards</h2>
I built interactive dashboards to make my data visualizations more accessible and user-friendly. By learning how to use the Shiny package in R, I structured dashboards with both user interface (UI) and server components, allowing stakeholders to interact with and explore key data insights. I also worked on integrating multiple visualizations into a single dashboard and generating automated reports using R Markdown. This experience strengthened my ability to present data-driven findings in a dynamic and engaging format.

<h2>MODULE 4: Course Project</h2>
For my final project, I built an interactive Shiny dashboard to analyze U.S. census data and identify key demographic trends. The goal was to help a career services company target their advertising efforts based on factors like age, education, gender, and work class. I implemented various data visualizations, including histograms, box plots, and bar charts, allowing users to explore the dataset dynamically. This project reinforced my skills in data visualization, dashboard development, and R programming, providing hands-on experience in turning raw data into actionable insights.
